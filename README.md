## Overview
You can view my portfolio at [https://yourusername.github.io](https://yourusername.github.io).

This website highlights key projects I've worked on, including:
- Data visualization projects using **Tableau** and **Altair**.
- Data analysis projects using **SQL** and **Microsoft Excel**.
- Programming projects in **C++** and **Swift**.

### Projects Featured
- **Business Insights from Yelp Data: Analyzing Trends with Google BigQuery**
  - In this project, I used **Google BigQuery** to analyze large datasets from **Yelp**, finding trends in customer behavior and business performance. By processing and querying the data, I found valuable insights that helped me create a business plan. This project highlights my skills in **data analysis**, **SQL**, and **business strategy**, and demonstrates how to connect data analysis with real-world business situations.
- **C++ Dungeon Game: A Text-Based Adventure**
  - In this project, I developed a text-based dungeon crawler in **C++** where players explore a dungeon, encounter enemies, and solve puzzles. The game leverages object-oriented programming to create dynamic game mechanics, such as character stats, inventory systems, and combat sequences. By implementing features like random enemy generation I demonstrated my ability to write efficient, interactive code. This project showcases my skills in **C++**, **algorithm design**, and **game development**.
- **NHL Data Analysis: Insights from API-Driven Stats**
  - In this project, I used an **NHL statistics API** to gather and analyze data on player and team performance. I explored various questions related to team success, goal-scoring trends, and positional trends by querying the API for key statistics such as goals, assists, and face-off win percentages. Using this data, I developed insights into team trends and player contributions. This project showcases my skills in **API integration**, **data analysis**, and **sports analytics**, with a focus on understanding the dynamics of professional hockey.
